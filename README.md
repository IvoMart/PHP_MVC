# PHP MVC - Practicing MVC structure

We can find in this repository some folders to divide PHP files and work as ***Model - Control - View*** structure working pages.

For this hole process we will need to create a 
1. Vista
- Login page
- Navbar section
- Menu section
- Footer section
2. Controller
- controlador.plantilla.php
  - In this case we are using a unic layout to display all sections. Whenever the route changes the content of the single page switches.
3. Model
- MySql DB conection for assambling the login data and to store products data and CRUD info to db.
